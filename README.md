# Pokedex
**Infinum task**

Pokedex is a front-end webpage that uses http://pokeapi.co/ to get data about pokemon's. On the webpage you can watch all Pokemons on the Pokemon list navigation, click on any Pokemon name and see details about that Pokemon and add Pokemon to my Pokemon list. You can do that by pressing Pokeball in a row that shows Pokemon you want to "catch". On the my Pokemon list you can go into details on the same way as before and you can release Pokemon which is actually deleting rows in my Pokemon table.
